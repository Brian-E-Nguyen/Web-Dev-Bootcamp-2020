# Section 28: AJAX and API's

## 1. Intro to AJAX

AJAX is an acronym with the following terms

- ***A***synchronous
- ***J***avaScript
- ***A***nd
- ***X***ML

This refers to a concept of loading or sending information on a given website or application. Like on reddit, you get new posts as you constantly scroll. Requests are being made to reddit to load more posts.

Instead of retrieving HTML, CSS, and JS, we would be receiving data, like in JSON or XML.

The idea of AJAX is creating apps where using JS, you can load, fetch, save, or send data

## 2. Intro to API's

***A***pplication ***P***rogramming ***I***nterface (API) is a very broad term where a software interacts with another piece of software. When people talk about API's, they usually talk about web API's. Some companies expose their endpoints, which will respond with code for consumers. It's like a portal into a different application. They occur over HTTP.

For example, on this website called [Cryptonator](https://www.cryptonator.com/api/), it gives us an endpoint for us to use, and it returns us JSON value

It's an interface not for humans, but rather web pages.

Some of them are free, some of them are not. It costs money for companies to receive requests

There are a bunch of different API's, like weather, Spotify song trends, Twitter etc. Long story short, there are many API's and we will be focusing on Web API's
