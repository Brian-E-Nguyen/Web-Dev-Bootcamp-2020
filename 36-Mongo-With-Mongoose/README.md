# Section 36: Connecting To Mongo With Mongoose

## 1. What is Mongoose

Node has a Mongo driver called **Mongoose**, which is used to connect to a Mongo database. Mongoose is an **ODM**, which could mean

- Object Data Mapper
- Object Document Mapper

ODM's like Mongoose map documents coming from a database into usable JavaScript objects. Mongoose provides ways for use to model out our application data and define a schema

Basically, it helps us handle Mongo objects easier and adds on some nice features that we can create for ourselves
