# 30. Node JS

## 1. Intro to Node JS

Until recently, we could only run JavaScript code in a web browser.   Node is a JavaScript runtime that executes code **outside of the browser.** We can use the same JavaScript syntax we know and love to write **server-side code,** instead of relying on other languages like Python or Ruby.

## 2. What is Node Used For?

- Web Servers
    - AJAX & API's
    - Making your own API's
- Command Line Tools
    - applications that run on your command line that doesn't have a traditional UI, like NPM
- Native Apps (VSCode is a Node app!)
- Video Games
- Drone Software
- A Whole Lot More!
