# Section 50: Authentication From Scratch

Most apps, or anything nowadays, have some sort of authentication. We will make our own authentication (authN) from scratch so that we get an idea how it works. It's really helpful to understand how all of the pieces fit together. This section has two parts:

1. how does authN work, how to store passwords, what it means to salt a password etc.
2. implementing authN in an Express app
